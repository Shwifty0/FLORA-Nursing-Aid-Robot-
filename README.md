**Final Year Project**

## Motivation
The primary reason that motivated us to work on this project is the relentless effort that nurses all over the world put into their work. Our goal for the robot is not to replace their jobs, but quite the opposite: to support them in their roles.

## Background
Nurses are an essential part of our healthcare, and with the threat and demand of the novel Covid-19, the need for nurses has amplified. The nursing profession is facing shortages due to a lack of potential educators, high turnover, and inequitable workforce distribution. We wish to provide a solution that could help healthcare sectors reduce the said difficulties.

## Problem Statement
Since we have established that the profession of Nursing is an integral part of patient care, and it constantly is required to adapt to changes in the healthcare system. A role for robots to aid nurses exists both in hospitals and elderly care facilities. Robots may effectively relieve the burden on Nurses, allowing them to concentrate on tasks pertaining to their primary duties.

## Implemented Solution
In order to cater to the problem statement, we have created a robot that collaborates with Nurses to maximize their efficiency by automating logistic tasks concerned with medical equipment and supply storage.
