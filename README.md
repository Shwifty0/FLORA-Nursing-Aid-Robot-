# FLORA-Nursing-Aid-Robot-
Final Year Project (Muhammad Ozair (02-132182-019))
Motivation
The primary reason that motivated us to work on this project  is the relentless effort that nurses all over the world put into  their work. Our goal for the robot is not to replace their jobs,  but quite the opposite: to support them in their roles.

Background
Nurses are an essential part of our healthcare and with the  threat and demand of the novel Covid-19, the need for  nurses has amplified. The nursing profession is facing  shortages due to a lack of potential educators, high  turnover, and inequitable workforce distribution. We wish  to provide a solution that could help healthcare sectors  reduce the said difficulties.

Problem Statement![image](https://github.com/Shwifty0/FLORA-Nursing-Aid-Robot-/assets/102323082/205b22b2-98c0-4cbb-83bb-ef42834551c4)
Since we have established that the profession of  Nursing is an integral part of patient care, and it  constantly is required to adapt to changes in the  healthcare system. A role for robots to aid nurses  exists both in hospitals and elderly care facilities.  Robots may effectively relieve the burden on Nurses  allowing them to concentrate on tasks pertaining to  their primary duties.

Implemented  Solution
In order to cater to the problem statement, we have created a robot that collaborates with Nurses to  maximize their efficiency by automating logistic  tasks concerned with medical equipment  and  supply storage.
